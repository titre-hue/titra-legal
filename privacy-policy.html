    <h1>titra — Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 27 February 2026</p>

    <h2>What titra Does</h2>
    <p>titra is a GLP-1 medication tracking app that helps you log doses, track side effects, and monitor your treatment journey. Your health is personal, and we treat your data that way.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>titra stores your medication doses, side effects, weight entries, and app preferences. All data is stored locally on your device by default. If you enable Cloud Sync, your data is encrypted and stored via Supabase (hosted on AWS). We do not collect your name, email address, or any personal identifiers unless you create a Cloud Sync account.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not access your camera, contacts, location, photos, or files. We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs. We do not sell, share, or monetise your data in any way.</p>

    <h2>Health Data</h2>
    <p>titra processes sensitive health information including medication dosages, side effects, and body weight. This data is used solely to provide you with tracking and insight features within the app. It is never shared with third parties, advertisers, or data brokers.</p>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>titra+ subscriptions are processed by Google Play or the Apple App Store. We do not see or store your payment details. Subscription status is managed through RevenueCat, which receives only an anonymous app user ID — no personal or health data.</p>

    <h2>AI-Powered Features</h2>
    <p>titra+ includes predictive features such as the Serum Level Predictor, Side Effect Forecaster, and Titration Roadmap. These run entirely on your device using pharmacokinetic models — your data is never sent to external AI services or cloud processing.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>App lock uses a PIN hashed with SHA-256 — your PIN is never stored in plain text. Biometric authentication is handled by your device's secure enclave. Cloud Sync data is transmitted over TLS and stored encrypted at rest.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all local data from Settings at any time. If you use Cloud Sync, you can also delete your cloud data from within the app. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. If you uninstall titra without deleting cloud data, you may request deletion by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>titra uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <p><strong>RevenueCat</strong> — subscription management. Receives an anonymous user ID only. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">Privacy policy</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Supabase</strong> — cloud sync (optional). Stores encrypted health data if you enable sync. <a href="https://supabase.com/privacy">Privacy policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>titra is not intended for use by anyone under 18. We do not knowingly collect data from minors.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal data at any time. If you are in the EU/EEA, you have additional rights under GDPR including data portability and the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you are in California, you have rights under the CCPA including the right to know what data is collected and the right to opt out of data sales (we do not sell data).</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL. We will notify users of material changes through an in-app notice.</p>
