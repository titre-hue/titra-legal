    <h1>titra — Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: 27 February 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using titra, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>What titra Is</h2>
    <p>titra is a personal health tracking tool designed to help you log GLP-1 medication doses, monitor side effects, and visualise your treatment progress.</p>

    <div class="important">
      <strong>Medical Disclaimer:</strong> titra is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice. All predictions, forecasts, and insights are based on general pharmacokinetic models and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your medication regimen.
    </div>

    <h2>titra+ Subscription</h2>
    <p>titra offers a free tier and a premium subscription (titra+). Subscriptions are billed through Google Play or the Apple App Store and are subject to the respective store's terms. You can cancel your subscription at any time through your device's subscription settings.</p>
    <p>Free trials, if offered, automatically convert to a paid subscription unless cancelled before the trial period ends. Refunds are handled by the respective app store according to their refund policies.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of all data you enter into titra. We do not claim any rights to your health data. See our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how your data is stored and protected.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use titra only for its intended purpose — personal health tracking. You may not reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app, or use it to develop competing products.</p>

    <h2>Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
    <p>While we strive to make titra's tracking and predictive features as accurate as possible, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of pharmacokinetic models, side effect predictions, or serum level estimates. Individual responses to medication vary significantly. These features are intended for informational purposes only.</p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep titra available and functioning reliably, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted access. We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time. Cloud Sync availability depends on third-party infrastructure providers.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, titra and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, health outcomes, profits, or goodwill arising from your use of the app. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for titra+ in the 12 months preceding any claim.</p>

    <h2>Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless titra and its developers from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your use of the app or violation of these terms.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to titra if you violate these terms. You may stop using titra at any time by uninstalling the app. Upon termination, your local data remains on your device until you delete it. Cloud data can be deleted through the app or by contacting us.</p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of titra after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. We will notify users of material changes through an in-app notice.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
